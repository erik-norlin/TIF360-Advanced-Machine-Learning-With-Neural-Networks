# TIF360-Advanced-Machine-Learning-With-Neural-Networks
Course TIF360 at Chalmers University. The focus here has been to become familiar and implement state-of-the-art techniques within deep learning such as graph neural networks, convolutional neural networks, reinforcement learning (Deep-Q) and transformers using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
